        <h4>Selection Sort, O(n<sup>2</sup>)</h4>
        <p>
          The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly searching for the
          smallest element in the array and putting it at the beginning (then
          moving on to the next subarray). Code:

        <h4>Merge Sort, O(n * log(n))</h4>
        <p>
          The merge sort algorithm takes an array and recursively divides it
          into havles until the halves cannot be broken down any further. Then,
          the created halves get merged together in a sorted manner and you
          eventually end up with the original array being sorted. (note: this
          algorithm uses O(n) space)

        <h4>
          Quick Sort, O(n<sup>2</sup>) (but is usually closer to O(n * log(n))
        </h4>
        <p>
          Quick sort takes in an array and chooses a pivot element (in this
          example, the pivot is chosen using a random index in the array range).
          Then, all of the elements less than the pivot get placed on the left
          side and the rest on the right side of the pivot. Then, quick sort is
          recursively called on the two sides until they cannot be divided any
          further.

        <h4>Bubble Sort, O(n<sup>2</sup>)</h4>
        <p>
          Bogo sort is probably the only algorithm that is more naive than this
          one. Bubble sort works by repeatedly traversing the array and swapping
          predecessor elements with their successor if the predecessor is larger
          until the array is sorted. So, the larger elements 'bubble' up.
